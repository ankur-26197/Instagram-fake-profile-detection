# Instagram-fake-profile-detection
Hands on project to train and develop a neural network to detect fake instagram profiles

This project is a learning outcome of the course by https://www.coursera.org/. It provides a good start for the beginners as a tutorial is added in the jupyter notebook file to
successfully complete the project. It is also helpful for people who have the knowledge of Artifical Neural Networks, have implemented models from scratch and are now interested
to learn how to use tensorflow and keras to construct these models in a more simplistic way.
